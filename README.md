### patches
Contains the sets of patches to various codebases that I've needed to edit. All
stored here as patches to keep them centralised.

### scripts
* **docrunch.sh** - run from /usr/src to build the kernel. Can provide gcc or
  crunchcc as an argument to choose the compiler.
* **envs.sh** - source this (`. path/to/envs.sh`) to get environmental
  variables required by liballocs and the dependencies.
